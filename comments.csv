"2016-02-17T15:55:01.584Z","Ralph","Bruce","221","Quite impressive...."
"2015-12-31T21:25:06.017Z","Bill","Bruce","167","Just wondering. If we're going to do this sort of discrimination, might it be more tidy to keep a dictionary of HttpStatus codes that is indexed by exception type. Then we could just say something like (excuse the made up language) status = ExceptionToStatusDictionary[e.GetType].ifAbsent(defaultStatus)."
"2016-02-01T15:08:30.925Z","Brett","Bruce","193","Are you planning to update unit test? "
"2015-07-27T01:10:31.485Z","Tom","Ralph","14","Thanks Russ for the quick fix."
"2015-11-19T16:40:46.535Z","Tom","Ralph","134","Shouldn't this variable be get/set in synchronized getter/setters?"
"2015-11-19T15:02:04.619Z","Tom","Ralph","134","Why are you using a separate variable to check if it's running.  Why no use isRunning?"
"2016-01-20T13:55:12.741Z","Bruce","Ralph","181","The default for destination datastore is <local> (same datastore).  Should we add this as well?"
"2016-01-20T13:47:46.344Z","Bill","Ralph","181","Perhaps you meant to enter something meaningful here but inadvertently had your search's regular expression inserted instead? :)"
"2016-02-19T09:59:00.996Z","Ralph","Karen","229","Sorry, but Bruce's checkin seems to have created a conflict with your changes."
"2016-02-11T16:49:25.238Z","Ralph","Karen","214","Very nice, Kavitha.  It took me about 6 months to figure out how to properly address git merge conflicts."
"2016-02-10T23:11:38.939Z","Bruce","Karen","214","Nice job.  You just need to merge a couple of files with Bhavin's changes to resolve the conflicts."
"2015-12-03T18:45:57.304Z","Brett","Bruce","145","Can we put in method?"
"2016-01-19T17:29:59.273Z","Brett","Bruce","178","Info: We have lot of common code across MO class. For future part of code cleanup we should use inheritance to place common code in super class."
"2016-02-17T20:22:08.390Z","Ralph","Bruce","224","Aaaaah, do you have to take it out?  I promise not to tell anyone about it...."
"2015-11-12T21:00:39.143Z","Bruce","Brett","122","Probably be good to test for a field you did not request (like name) and make sure it is null."
"2016-02-02T12:42:57.246Z","Ralph","Brett","195","What, no ""testGetVirtualMachinesForHer""?  :)"
"2016-02-02T12:41:25.616Z","Ralph","Brett","195","I'm sure that Debbie will clean this up, but for now I suggest we say something like ""The current high availability status of this virtual machine.  This value is computed from various sources and so its retrieval may adversely affect the response time of a request.""
  "
"2016-02-02T12:35:23.107Z","Bruce","Brett","195","Does the HiveSortKey list of values match our sort params exactly?  Or does it contain fields that we do not pass back to the user?  Also, it would probably be better to pass these back as lower case strings, to match our JSON keys."
"2016-02-02T12:31:21.495Z","Ralph","Brett","195","Does this mean that there are times that a Hive_Get will fail but a Hive_List will succeed in finding the targeted Hive?  I'm worried that all of this logic is in place for a scenario (pre-Himalayas) that we don't really want to support.  I'm for simplifying this code and just doing a Hive_Get in the pre-Himalayas case."
"2016-02-02T12:29:39.782Z","Bruce","Brett","195","I added the transient so that coverity wouldn't complain about non-serializable fields.  I can lookup the coverity error when I get into the office."
"2016-02-02T12:24:37.370Z","Ralph","Brett","195","This shouldn't be marked as ""required"" or else the documentation will indicate that it will always be returned."
"2016-02-02T12:09:14.569Z","Bruce","Brett","195","Should be _id, not _Id"
"2015-11-18T18:53:38.116Z","Brett","Bruce","131","Can we use Collections.isNullOrEmpty(backups)? Just in case."
"2015-11-18T16:48:24.034Z","Brett","Bruce","131","Can we move this method to SvtObjectCommonUtils? 
Two reasons: One, if one wants to use in future then it will be fetch from common location
Second, it will be easier in future to centralize all thrift call.
Just an idea."
"2015-11-18T16:46:36.906Z","Brett","Bruce","131","Same check point."
"2015-11-18T16:44:46.970Z","Brett","Bruce","131","Do we need to break the loop once find the id?"
"2015-11-18T16:42:11.226Z","Brett","Bruce","131","Same comment. Scenario, say suppose two threads running concurrently. Before one thread rename backup, other thread deletes the same backup. In that case, we need guarding point."
"2015-11-18T16:38:25.367Z","Brett","Bruce","131","Don't you need check point to see backup found or not?"
"2015-11-17T22:25:56.356Z","Bill","Bruce","131","Is it too difficult to either make a table, i.e., return backupToMoTable[backupState.printString().toLowerCase()]; or use reflection to avoid this big switch."
"2015-12-31T22:58:58.499Z","Bruce","Brett","162","In here, should we also check for body parameters that are passed in but we don't recognize them?  For example, if I passed in datacenter for a restore in place that would be a mistake."
"2015-12-31T22:49:43.512Z","Bruce","Brett","162","Probably want to move this below the check for a valid backup and just pass in the backup object?  No big deal either way,"
"2015-12-28T16:29:04.136Z","Bruce","Brett","162","I don't think we reuse the constant SvtActionConstants.BACKUP_ACTION_RESTORE_VM anywhere except here (once BackupActionMO is refactored).  It would be easier to understand if we use value = ""/backups/{backupId}/restore"" and drop the constant."
"2015-12-28T16:26:30.721Z","Bruce","Brett","162","I think it might be better to have specific operations for each URL - rename and restoreBackup - rather than combining them."
"2015-12-28T16:22:11.881Z","Bruce","Brett","162","I'm not sure it makes sense to keep this base class for Rename and Restore since the only thing in common is the type.  We're probably better off splitting the MOs and validators into separate classes for each URL."
"2015-12-28T16:20:53.641Z","Bruce","Brett","162","I don't think this method is used anymore, since the actions moved to the URL from the body."
"2015-12-28T16:18:52.936Z","Bruce","Brett","162","I think we're better off with separate validators for each URL.  There is not much in common between rename vs. restore."
"2015-12-28T16:11:05.779Z","Tom","Brett","162","Just a thought, it might be worthwhile to put all the actions MO in a subdirectory - com.simplivity.restapi.v1.mo.actions.  At least that way, you could easily filter out what actions you support."
"2015-12-28T16:08:59.484Z","Tom","Brett","162","Any reason why you are using snake_case here - create_virtual_machine?"
"2015-12-28T16:08:22.003Z","Tom","Brett","162","Should be snake case."
"2015-11-20T17:59:02.853Z","Bruce","Ralph","135","How about changing SvtUtils.getOmniCubeVirtualController() to return SvtConstants.LOCALHOST if the file is not found?"
"2016-01-20T14:25:00.103Z","Bill","Bruce","180","Could you please align these fields by visibility, i.e., HIMALAYA_FEATURE_VERSION, featureVersion, logger."
"2016-01-29T17:20:06.098Z","Bruce","Brett","192","Nice!  Adding datacenter info should make the REST API and the GUI faster by requiring fewer thrift calls."
"2015-08-04T20:54:51.173Z","Bruce","Tom","21","Is this line repeating line 97?"
"2016-01-11T22:43:15.022Z","Bill","Bruce","171","Just a question Bruce - why do you have to implement init and destroy? Do current Java implementations require it or are these placeholders for a subsequent implementation?"
"2015-07-21T17:47:26.265Z","Tom","Bruce","10","Looks fine, other than the things I pointed out inline."
"2015-07-21T17:46:24.090Z","Tom","Bruce","10","Maybe we should put the ""limit"" as a static variable under SvtConstants.java, so that it can be easily changed there instead of in every file."
"2015-07-21T17:39:36.340Z","Tom","Bruce","10","Ditto"
"2015-07-21T17:39:30.581Z","Tom","Bruce","10","I know we do not have a final decision on where to put the curley braces (new line or not) but for now, could you put them on the same line to be consistent?"
"2015-07-21T17:37:41.861Z","Tom","Bruce","10","I think of ""fields"" as an attribute in an object, e.g. datastore.name.  Could this be compareTwoObjects?"
"2015-11-03T19:33:54.744Z","Bruce","Brett","104","Why the change to default throwing a bad exception?  I think we should be explicit here and add case CREATION in case someone adds another sort field above without updating this switch statement.  I know this part of the code is not covered, but I think that is OK."
"2015-12-01T15:37:53.103Z","Tom","Brett","141","I think I put this here to automatically create a config file if one is not there.  Since I cannot find anywhere in the code that it is called, it should be ok to remove.  In any case, the sva build script should be creating the config for you."
"2015-11-13T14:36:47.007Z","Ralph","Bill","124","Good job, Boyd.  "
"2015-09-16T23:43:51.275Z","Bill","Brett","48","Newline?"

"2015-12-08T13:03:51.830Z","Ralph","Bruce","147","Are there unit tests for both ""NA"" as well as ""0""?"
"2015-09-03T14:57:16.696Z","Bruce","Tom","34","Good changes.  Could you add the copyright info to the top of each file."
"2015-11-13T17:39:30.979Z","Bruce","Brett","125","It might be faster to pre-process all the fields in the fields array to trim them and make them lower case.  Then you can do a simple field.equals(""id"").  Also, if and when we switch to Java 7, we can use a case statement with a string (field)."
"2016-04-12T21:18:49.183Z","Bruce","Karen","356","I think you need to add this class to TestSuite.java so that it runs with the full suite, right?"
"2016-04-12T21:15:03.381Z","Bruce","Karen","356","Can you add some comments about how this works.  Looks like you create an svt-session-start and then sftp the /home/svtcli/.svt_session file and use that for the Map<String,String> sessionMap.

I think the bedrock team is changing the way that sessions are handled so they are not stored in this file anymore (because there is a security hole).  "
"2016-04-12T15:20:23.786Z","Ralph","Karen","356","How about creating a ""grant_type"" enumeration that contains the supported values.  That would also make it easier to test for a non-supported grant type."

"2016-02-03T21:32:55.087Z","Bruce","Brett","201","Can you update this message with the full set of accepted fields.  For example policy_id."

"2015-10-02T15:38:38.375Z","Brett","Bruce","63","Same as above."
"2015-10-02T15:38:28.140Z","Brett","Bruce","63","Don't catch exception if we are not intend to do anything. But here we can make reader null and help JVM for GC."
"2015-10-02T15:37:34.318Z","Tom","Bruce","63","We should format this file :)"
"2015-12-16T20:24:07.812Z","Brett","Bruce","154","Instead of logging error in log file in else part, can we return same object in else part? Because we might miss some obj type and log error message. Something like, else {   return objType; }
Purpose behind is that we should trust thrift for objType, convert those objTypes which we want to change and remaining keep as it is coming from thrift."

"2015-10-28T20:02:47.053Z","Ralph","Brett","92","The root of this work is not that the API that has been provided by the server is inadequate.  This is a result of the collision between how Thrift generates code, and how Swagger interprets the code that has been flagged as being part of the REST documentation set.  Fundamentally, Thrift provides RPCs, and not an API.  AffectedObject, as defined in SvtControl.thrift, is exactly what is needed by the client.  But once it gets compiled, the generated code contains a large number of helper methods/properties.  They are there to help support the RPC illusion, and I'm assuming that they are necessary in order for Thrift to function.  
But what we are finding is that if we reference a Thrift-based class directly with a Swagger annotation, then Swagger is defining the object not just by its ""real"" properties (like ""id"" and ""type"", for affectedObjects), but also picking up and exposing unintended properties (like ""setType"" and ""setId"").  I haven't been able to figure out a way to direct Swagger to only pluck out certain properties from a referenced class, and so the next best approach (at least in my mind) is to create a local shim class around the Thrift class that only defines the properties that we want to expose via the API.  If someone can think of a better approach to deal with this situation in a cleaner and/or more efficient manner, let's discuss."
"2015-10-28T19:05:06.602Z","Bill","Brett","92","If you don't like the API I provided, perhaps the server-side should be doing the aggregation by type. I haven't seen the requirement, or I would have done it. I certainly would have done it at origin rather than on the client. Yet another nit - affected-objects accumulate in a sequence. That sequence is both temporal and location-based. Right now, I believe the sequence they are returned to the client reflects a temporal sequence. Aggregating them destroy's that sequence. We really need to know what knowledge we want to encode. Right now it's type and object. Are sequence, and location important? Are other things important?"

"2016-01-08T18:24:50.961Z","Ralph","Bruce","170","Here's my two cents on the ""where should we validate inputs"" discussion:  I do like the idea of having syntactical validation (e.g., is the input provided just plain wrong for the targeted task?) being done in the controller, because it does fit with the responsibility of the controller.  This does not mean that the service doesn't have to do any validation, but what it would validate is different.  It should validate things that only the service can (given its ability to interact with the system underneath it), which we can call semantics.  I guess what I'm saying is that, in our situation, the controller is responsible for making sure that the MO that gets sent to the service is formed correctly, but it will be the service that has to make sure that the information contained in the MO is valid for what is being done.   This is similar to the division-of-labor when doing XML processing where the parser will validate the structure, but the processor will validate that the input makes sense.  
What I'm not sold on is the benefits of having this validation done within a Spring-based Validator.  Without knowing all of the details of what a Validator-based actually provides, when I did the Backup rewrite I really wanted to just write a private validation method within the controller to deal with the data that was gathered.  The code that I ended up checking in basically bypasses any benefits of being part of a Validator.  So going forward if we do put syntactical validation in the controller (which I think is a good thing), should we bother with leveraging the Spring Validator hooks?  I don't think so."

"2015-09-09T11:18:06.884Z","Tom","Brett","36","You only create one rule at a time.  It should be createPolicyRule (not plural and not prefix with set)."
"2015-09-09T11:16:26.170Z","Tom","Brett","36","The create operations should be consistent in naming with others.  You should rename it ""createDatastore"".  A set operation includes more than just create sometimes.  It can include backup, restore, clone, etc. (not for this object of course).  The method name should be named appropriately."
"2015-09-09T11:13:52.034Z","Tom","Brett","36","The name ""setBackupDetails"" is confusing.  It is not actually setting any details on the backup.  It is performing an action, e.g. rename or restore.  You should rename it to ""performBackupOperation""."
"2015-09-09T11:07:49.351Z","Tom","Brett","36","There should be a plural and singular form of each object.  Plural form should be the key returned on lists and singular should be returned on get by id."
"2015-09-09T02:37:03.051Z","Tom","Brett","36","Can we create a generic service class that has the standard methods that objects need, e.g. getAll, getById, create (or set), and delete?  Any object that has one-off methods can reside in the specific service implementation itself.  This way, we can remove all the specific I<Object>Service.java (might not be possible in Spring since you have to AutoWire an interface) and consolidate the code base.  For example,

public interface IService {
    Map<String, Object> getAll(String field, int limit, int offset, String sort, String order) throws TException, TaskException;
    Map<String, Object> getById(String id) throws TException, TaskException;
    Map<String, Object> create(Object mo) throws TException, TaskException;
    Map<String, Object> performOperation(String id, Object mo) throws ObjectNotFoundException, TException, TaskException;
    Map<String, Object> delete(String id) throws TaskException, TException;
}

There are objects, i.e. tasks, that we could not implement all the methods for (i.e. getAll).  For those, we can just return NotImplementedException.

We do not have to do it in this patch, but it might be worthwhile in a follow up patch."
"2015-09-09T02:26:47.721Z","Tom","Brett","36","The package name should be in lower-case, i.e. mo.  See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/package/namingpkgs.html - ""Package names are written in all lower case to avoid conflict with the names of classes or interfaces."""
"2015-09-09T02:21:15.368Z","Tom","Brett","36","The response should be ""backups"" since it is a list of backups.  This applies to the other objects too.  When returning multiple objects, we should use the plural form."

"2016-03-21T21:58:11.034Z","Bruce","Karen","318","I think we want people to run the entire suite by default - making sure all the tests pass.  TestRunner has a main method to run the entire TestSuite (which deletes the test_results.log before running it).  In Eclipse, I usually right click on TestSuite and run as JUnit to reset the file and run all the tests.  

Will that still work correctly?"
"2016-03-21T21:53:28.986Z","Bruce","Karen","318","Could you fill in this section as well.  Thanks,"
"2016-03-21T20:31:51.854Z","Bruce","Karen","318","Looks like all of these system parameters need to be passed in via the command line or the tests will fail, right?  

Can you validate them and print an error message if any are missing and stop the tests?

Also, can you update the rest-automation/readme.md with instructions on how to build and run rest-automation.  That should help."
"2016-03-21T20:29:27.742Z","Ralph","Karen","318","Since we're still going to want to run the tests from Eclipse, couldn't we still keep these properties around, but override them if information is provided as arguments on the command line?"
